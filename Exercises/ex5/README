=========================================================================================
=        An explanation about the differences between the two UML diagrams:             =
=========================================================================================
In the initial UML diagram-
we decided on a basic division of the objects that we knew would be in the game for sure while attaching to
the API and its requirements.
As for our free choice - from the beginning we understood that we wanted to divide the tree class into 2
classes of leaf and stem (called tree) and knew that the leaf class will extends from gameObjects.

In the final UML diagram-
we added classes related to the bonus part.
We have added classes for the carriable objects, the score counter and the energy progress bar - all of them
extends from gameObject.
We have also added a "removableObject" interface that returns the layers of the objects that implement it
(to be exact - the objects are: leaf, carriable objects and removable block).
We have also added another class named "RemovableBlock" that inherits from "Block" and we use it to know the
layers of tree and the terrain (detail explanation about it is above).
Another decision that can be seen in the final UML (unlike the initial one) is that the carriable objects we
added in the game will inherit from "gameObject" class and implements the "RemovableObjects" interface.
We found that this is the best way for us to create the game.

Legend for the UML arrows -
Continuous line and full arrow - inheritance.
Dashed line and incomplete arrow - dependency.
Dashed line and full arrow - implements of interface.
Continuous line with full rhombus - aggregation.


=========================================================================================
=            An explanation about the way we made our infinite world:                   =
=========================================================================================
We examined the relationship between the avatar on which the camera follows to the boundaries of the screen
and divided in two cases - the right direction and the left direction.
In each case we added new objects on the side to which the avatar advanced and removed the objects that
disappeared from "the player's eyes" namely from the boundaries of the screen.

For the deleting objects -
For the carriable objects we created a hashMap that saves the location and the object who in this location so
we get quick access for deleting them. In addition, for the tree and the terrain we created HashMap which
mapping XLocation to HashSet (the hashSet contains all the objects who associated with the current location)
and by that way we could removes the leaves of a specific tree and the blocks of the terrain.

We were able to access the object layers by getters methods and so we could delete them and only them.

We have taken care of an infinite world that maintains a recoverable randomness by sending a seed that depends
on the x-coordinate of the location where we want to produce the object. It should be noted that we send the
same seed to all the objects in order to make "the same world" depending on this seed.


=============================================================================================================
=An explanation about the way we chose to implement the trees package, and why we chose this particular way:=
=============================================================================================================
We created a package "trees" that includes 2 classes inside - a "Tree" class and a "Leaf" class.
We divided it in this way (so that the leaves have a separate class) in order to create "different leaves" for
each and different tree. Namely, we wanted to grill a random amount of leaves in random locations for each
tree separately so we thought that this partition will help us to achieve our goal in the best way.
In addition, another reason to create a separate class for the leaves is that the leaf has its own functions
and features like the transitions that are responsible for its falling, oscillations and restoration.


=========================================================================================
=  An explanation about the dilemmas or the design decisions we made during the work:   =
=========================================================================================
# We had a dilemma about the part of the deleting objects - about the way we will approach the layers of the
objects we want to delete -first we thought of using tags (getTag function) but in the end we decided not to
because it is feel to us less correctly in terms of OOP.
In our opinion- if we relied on the tag of a particular object it can ruin the realization which is based on
it in the Game Manger.
So, at the end we decided that for every object we want to delete- its class will implement an interface
("RemovableObject") that requires implementation of a getter method that returns the layer of the object.
This interface will be for the leaves and for the extra game objects.

# Regarding to the image rendering and the avatar movements - we wanted to know towards which direction the
object went last time. So we used Enum which keeping the last direction that the avatar advanced towards it.

# We added a class "RemovableBlock" for the tree class and the terrain class.
This class inherits from a block and has a function that returns the layer of the object.
The purpose is: when we want to create blocks that will assemble the trees (the stem to be exact)
and the terrain we can use this additional class so that later we can get their layer.
This class exists just for them (unlike other objects) because they are objects which consist of blocks so we
cant get their layer directly. The solution is a specific class that returns the desired layer.

Code optimization-
* Regarding the terrain - we defined that only the first two layers of the terrain should collide with the
avatar and the leaves. We did this by dividing the terrain into two layers - a top layer and the rest of the
remaining layers.
* Regarding the leaves - we defined two layers for the leaves "leafLayerBeforeFalling" and
"leafLayerWhenFalling" for the collision between the leaves to the terrain.
The function of the collision will be performed only on the falling leaves and by using that we saved run
time.
* We were debated whether to go through all the objects in the GameManager and delete the objects who exists
at the edges but in order to save run time we decided to create for each object a data structure (type
HashMap) that preserves the objects associated with the required location. By that way we spared us
unnecessary passage over all the objects.
It should be noted that the leaves are erased depending on the location of the stem to which they are
attached.

=                       An explanation about the BONUS part-                            =
=========================================================================================
We have added for the avatar an option of clicking down.
We added background music.
We added more game objects - toxic fish, regular fish, coins and a counter that counts the points the avatar
has accumulated.
We added energy progress bar for display the avatar's energy on the screen.
We added a goal to the game - the penguin character must collect a certain number of points in order to win
the game without being disqualified along the way. Disqualification will be considered when the penguin
reaches a negative number of points when the points are lowered by a toxic fish.
We added sound for eating fish and taking coins.
We added instructions at the beginning of the game.

      =    Remark   =
=============================
PAY ATTENTION:
There may be a situation where changing the screen size or changing the seed will cause the avatar to fall on
a toxic fish and thus the player will be disqualified immediately. In addition, we ran the game on the
university computers and part of the screen was hidden (in the default setting screen) and did not see the
energy progress bar - so if you do not see the energy progress bar, we want you to enlarge the window please.

We added 3 UML diagrams - "uml_before", "uml_after" (as required) and another one "simple_uml_after".
the "simple_uml_after" is to make it more convenient to read the uml_after diagram (without the over details
of the public things).

We hope you will enjoy to play in our game :)
HAVE A GOOD DAY :D
