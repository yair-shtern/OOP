# Object Oriented Programming


### PenguinGame
The last exercise of this course was to create an avatar game.
My colleague and I created a PinguinGame.
The main challenge was to create an endless world that doesn't change.
We added coins and good and bad objects to collect and gain or lose points.
The game is written in JAVA using the DanoGameLab platform,
implementing the Object object-oriented programming principles.
